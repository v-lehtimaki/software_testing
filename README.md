# Software Testing Assignment
This is our test suite for the open-source JavaScript utility library that can be found from https://github.com/tgcslearningtech/COMP.SE.200-2020-assignment built for the fall 2020 implementation of Software Testing.

See the test report for details about the testing process and results.

The library to be tested has been copied to the course_code directory to make it easy to access within the tests. The tests themselves reside in the tests directory. The exact test results can be found from the Travis CI build feed, and the coverage reports can be found from https://coveralls.io/github/v-lehtimaki/software_testing. The test cases and their results are also listed in the end report.
